# 🧠 Memo-Memorable

**Memo-Memorable** is a small educational memory game entirely built in **Python** using **Tkinter**, developed as a personal learning project.

Unlike typical memory games, this app aims to be genuinely **useful for memorization**, allowing you to pair concepts with definitions, code snippets, translations, or any content you want to learn. Whether it's `"Linked List"` ↔ `"class Node:"` or `"hello"` ↔ `"ciao"`, you can train both your memory and your mind!
